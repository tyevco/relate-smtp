## Community Project

Relate Mail is a community-maintained project. There is no SLA or guaranteed response time. Maintainers and contributors volunteer their time and will respond as availability allows.

The best way to get a fast response is to provide a clear, minimal reproduction of the issue and any relevant environment details (OS, Node/dotnet versions, Docker setup, etc.).
